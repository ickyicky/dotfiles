# DotFiles
doman

Settings include:
1. setting zsh as default shell
2. installing python3, git, zsh, neovim
3. setting zsh and vim setting and installing plugins

To apply settings simply run ./install.sh

TODOs:
1. Divide install.sh into Makefile, so other users can just copy my dotfiles or just set zsh as their default shell
2. Install IPython and also check how to install brew :) and if brew requires sudo and so on and so on, lots TODO on MacOS
3. Check installation of neovim on other platforms
4. Add other resources (.ssh config etc)
5. Add option to pack resources, not only unpack
6. Add installation of this fancy C-O zsh plugin
