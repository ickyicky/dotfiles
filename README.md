# DotFiles
doman

Settings include:
1. setting zsh as default shell
2. installing python3, git, zsh, neovim
3. setting zsh and vim setting and installing plugins

To apply settings simply run ./install.sh

TODOs:
1. Divide install.sh into Makefile, so other users can just copy my dotfiles or just set zsh as their default shell
2. Install IPython and correct PIP (from install pip script) 
3. Don't alias vim to nvim if there's no nvim in system
4. Add other resources (.ssh config etc)
5. Add option to pack resources, not only unpack
6. Add installation of this fancy C-O zsh plugin - change to ranger than lf
